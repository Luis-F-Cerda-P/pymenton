Then, manually updated references to 'AttributeField' in: the model, the controller, the views, the helper. This manual modifications include changing references inside the files (code) and the filenames themselves to the new name

References to this model where changed using the search function od VSCode and a thorough analysis. Also, some references to AttributeField (currently 'AttributeType') where corrected, since they went below the radar in the commit that did the change from 'AttributeField' to 'AttributeType'. It's possible that in the future we'll have to simply do a different generation of the bdatabase, giving the models and tables the correct names and columns from the start, since doing these changes later on becomes really difficult
